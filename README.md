# Restricted randomization procedures

A set of `Julia` functions to simulate _multi-arm_ clinical trials targeting _unequal allocation_. 
So far, _eight different randomization procedures_ have been implemented.
There is a _simulation example_ comparing procedures in terms of _**Balance-Randomness trade-off**_.

More details about the implemented randomization procedure can be found [here](https://github.com/yevgenryeznik/restricted-multi-arm/wiki)
